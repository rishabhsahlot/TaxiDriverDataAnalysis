# NYC Taxi Driver Data Analysis

This project is focused on analyzing the data of NYC Yellow taxis by clubbing it with education institution locations and crime data(police departments & crime).
We have additionally manually created tables for linking the different datasets. We have loaded the data into the MongoDB database.
